        <p>
            To alleviate poverty and improve food security by empowering vulnerable families 
            through sustainable livestock ownership. By providing each household with a cow,
             we enhance nutritional access, support agricultural productivity, and foster a 
             cycle of community support, lifting families out of poverty for lasting change.

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
            Girinka began as a cornerstone of Rwanda’s Vision 2020, a national initiative aimed 
            at lifting millions of families out of poverty and transforming communities across 
            the country. In Rwanda, cows are more than livestock—they’re symbols of wealth, dignity, 
            and community connection. Recognizing this deep cultural and economic significance, 
            Girinka was created to empower vulnerable families by giving them the life-changing 
            gift of a cow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the gift of a cow, families gain a source of nutrition through milk, organic 
            manure to boost crop yields, and a stepping stone toward financial independence. Beyond
             the individual household, Girinka strengthens community ties, as each family pledges to 
             pass on the first female calf to another family in need. Since its inception, Girinka has 
             distributed over 350,000 cows across Rwanda, impacting thousands of lives and fostering a 
             chain of shared opportunity and hope.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, Girinka stands as a testament to the power of unity, resilience, and a vision for a 
            brighter, hunger-free Rwanda. Through the commitment of families, communities, and supporters,
             we continue to build a future where every Rwandan can thrive.
